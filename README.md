# kotlin-golf

### Rules
1. Provide implementations for the functions in UtilitiesKt using as few characters as possible.
2. Nothing should be reused from `src/main/java` in your implementation.
3. External libraries can be imported.
4. The tests must all be successful.

### Execution

`$ ./gradlew cleanTest test`

Look for a console statement with the number of characters in your implementation:

```
Searching src/main/java found 4686 chars not including whitespace
Searching src/main/kotlin found 562 chars not including whitespace
```
